                <p>
                    Hello my name is Andrew Souva, I am a Full Time Student at Southwestern Collage and aspiring
                    Back-end web developer. Where to begin I grew up with the internet and it has never ceases to amaze
                    me with its efficiency at transferring information be it personal, educational, or for business. I have
                    watched the web grow to dominate traditional Brick and mortar stores and I have become enamored
                    with it. So, after some deep soul searching I decided contributing to the internetâ€™s growth would be a
                    fitting career path.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                     As I learn to code in languages such as PHP and MYSQL it becomes apparent how the web is
                     taken for granted by the general populace. Behind the Curtains of HTML and CSS is a truly amazing
                     world of back end development, it is a world filled with truly dynamic challenges, Logical solutions, and 
                     awesome triumphs. To me this is the type work that I could never get bored of.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    However on in web development coding is not the whole hog in web design plays a big part in the
                    layout of a site and can impact how the user receives information and how concise the information on the
                    page is. Although my focus is Back end development I think it is vastly important to at least have a
                    functional understanding aesthetic design. Therefore, I see it as a secondary objective in my educational
                    career.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I am currently on track to earn my associates at the end of fall 2018. I see this only as a
                    Milestone in my educational Career because in a dynamic field like web development you never stop
                    studying code because it is always being changed and improved.       
                </p>
