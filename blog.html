                   So, Todays the day I put this Site up truth be told I’m very nervous. I’ve gone through numerous
                   iterations of this site and I guess this will have to do there’s definitely a lot I can improve upon but that’s
                   what’s being a developer is about always improving on something be it code or design I think the next
                   iteration of this site should be more design focused I got a course on design based in photoshop waiting
                   for me to take on in Udemy which I’m planning to start taking next week. I think I’ll use this site as a play thing
                   to experiment with layout and design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    what has this suave individual been up to as of lately you might be asking yourself. Well all
                    manner of things, firstly I’ve been downing copious amounts of coffee using Alton Brown’s method
                    French press, half a cup of ground coffee, pinch of kosher salt, and 24 ounces of hot water. And studying
                    seems like my daily habit consists of eating, Sleeping and Studying now, been reading <i>The Joy of
                    PHP</i> by Alan Forbes. It’s a very no-nonsense guide to PHP and the Author does an amazing job
                    explaining the Important Tags in PHP and how to use them. PHP will come in handy when I’m working
                    Back End Systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, PHP is a declining language Therefore as of 8th I’ve been taking an online
                    web developer boot camp on Udemy taught by Colt Steele who teaches in person boot camps in San
                    Francisco. He goes over all the basics for front end development which include HTML, CSS, and Java 
                    Script the first two being review for me. But he then focuses in on Node.js which is a growing Back End
                    Platform, so I guess you could say I’m covering my bases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, I Discovered a new way to study called the Pomodoro Technique. Developed by
                    Francesco Cirillo in the 80’s, it breaks down work into twenty-five-minute chunks which are followed by
                    a five-minute break where every fourth chunk is followed with a 15-minute-long break. I’ve gotten
                    amazing results with this technique as I don’t find myself mentally fatigued as quickly. I also find myself
                    remembering more It could just be a placebo but I find myself able to study more and work harder then 
                    I was before. Well that’s all for now until next time see you space cow boy.
                </p>

                   The smell of coffee and the blue glow of the computer screen is how I start most of my days
                   today I have my nose in the Book <i>HTML & CSS design and build websites</i> by Jon Duckett. I really
                   like this book it’s layout is part explanation, part reference. My only complaint is the binding is horrible
                   in order to use it you have to dedicate one hand to holding it open. It became so infuriating that I sent it
                   to office depot to be rebound with coil binding. Now it’s a joy to use every tag and element is given in
                   depth explanations which really helps those who are new HTML and CSS.
